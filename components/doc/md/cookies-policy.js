## 1. What Are Cookies?

Cookies are small text files stored on your device by websites or apps to remember information about your activity. While traditional cookies are used in web browsers, **mobile apps use equivalent technologies** like local storage, app preferences, and SDK-based tracking to achieve similar purposes.

---

## 2. Why We Use Cookies (and Similar Technologies)

We use cookies and similar tracking technologies to:

- Provide and secure core app features
- Remember your preferences (e.g. language, theme)
- Analyze user behavior to improve the app
- Detect crashes and performance issues
- Deliver relevant content and features
- Comply with legal or regulatory requirements

These tools help us ensure Rolling Sagas remains fast, stable, and tailored to your needs.

## 3. Technologies We Use

We may use the following types of technologies:

### a. Essential Technologies

Required for the app to function correctly, such as authentication, user sessions, and security mechanisms.

### b. Analytics Technologies

Used to understand app usage and improve performance. We use services like **Firebase Analytics** to gather anonymized, aggregated data about in-app activity.

### c. Preference Storage

We store user preferences locally on your device (e.g., layout choices, notification settings) to personalize your experience without needing to re-enter information.

### d. Third-Party SDKs

We may use third-party SDKs to integrate additional functionality, such as:

- **Crash reporting** (e.g., Firebase Crashlytics)
- **Social features or logins**
- **Payment and purchase tools**

These services may collect device and interaction data subject to their own privacy policies.

## 4. Managing Your Preferences

You can manage or restrict tracking technologies through:

- **Device Settings**: Most mobile operating systems allow you to control permissions, reset advertising IDs, or disable personalized ads.
- **OS Privacy Controls**: iOS and Android provide tools to manage tracking permissions across all apps.
- **In-App Settings**: Where available, Rolling Sagas may include controls for analytics and data usage preferences.

## 5. Your Consent

By using the Rolling Sagas app, you consent to our use of cookies and similar technologies as described in this policy, subject to the preferences you have set on your device or within the app.
